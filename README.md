Hw_toolkit is library for generating, manipulatin and analysis of HDL (verilog/vhdl...) code.
This library contains:
* components and helpers for Hw_toolkit
* simulations, verifications and test of components for Hw_toolikt
* tests of Hw toolikt itself
This library contains (will) components which we use at most in video processing/network applications.

Hw toolikit can be downloaded from there https://github.com/Nic30/HWToolkit or via pip.

In the first wave I will add most of the componets for AMBA AXI-stream.
