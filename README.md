# hwtStdLib
HW toolkit standard library

Hw toolkit is library for generating, manipulatin and analysis of HDL (verilog/vhdl...) code.
This library contains (will) components which we use at most in video processing/network applications.

In the first wave I will add most of the componets for AMBA AXI-stream.
