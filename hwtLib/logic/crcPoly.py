"""
Library of common CRC configurations

:note: POLY is the polynome of CRC and specifies which bits
    should be xored together.
:note: WIDTH - specifies the width of CRC state/value
:note: REFIN - If it is True the bits in each byte are reversed before processing.
:note: REFOUT If it is set to FALSE, the
    final value in the register is fed into the XOROUT stage directly,
    otherwise, if this parameter is TRUE, the final register value is
    reflected first.
:note: XOROUT This is an WIDTH-bit value. It is XORed to the final register value
    (after the REFOUT) stage before the value is returned as the official
    checksum.
