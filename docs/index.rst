Welcome to hwtLib's generated documentation!
============================================

This documentation is automatically generated from source code on every push into master which pass testing.
hwtLib is package of hardware components (like vhld/verilog library) for HWToolkit (hwt python3 module) it 
also contains commonly used helpers and types like uint64_t, UDP header etc.
Library is structuralized mostly by main interface of component class.

Interface of components are usually not shown in documentation directly,
because it is required to describe this properties in the doc explicitely.
Interfaces are added in _declr() method of unit and they can be seen in sourcecode same for parameters in _config().
However for components there is usually the schematic, which can be opened from link under the name of the component.
