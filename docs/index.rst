Welcome to hwtLib's generated documentation!
============================================

This documentation is automatically generated from source code on every push into master which pass testing.
hwtLib is package of hardware components (like vhld/verilog library) for HWToolkit (hwt python3 module) it 
also contains most used helpers and types like uint64_t, UDP header etc.
Library is structuralized mostly by main interface of component.

Interfaces of components are usually not shown in documentation directly 
instead they are declared in _declr() method of unit and they can be seen in sourcecode same for parameters in _config().
